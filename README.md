Created a simple staff list from the Microsoft 365/Entra Users who are active and are not Rooms or Generic users.

This utilises PHP and the Graph API, which makes it suitable for various use cases and can be used in part to generate staff lists for different purposes.

The output is an HTML table, but it could also be used to feed other data objects functionally.
